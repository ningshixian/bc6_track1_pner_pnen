      <text>(B) MCF10A cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) for up to eight hours. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested, RNA was isolated and used to determine expression levels of specific lncRNAs and mRNAs, using the SurePrint microarray platform (from Agilent). The heatmaps depict lncRNAs (left) and mRNAs (right) for which a &gt;1.5-fold (lncRNAs) or a &gt;2-fold (mRNA) change in expression was observed in at least one of the time points, compared to un-stimulated cells (time zero). Note that each row of the heatmap represents an individual lncRNAs/mRNAs, and values (see color scale at the bottom) indicate the log2 ratio of RNA levels between each time point and time zero.</text>

      <text>(A) Shown are levels of two EGF-regulated lncRNAs: the EGF-downregulated lncRNA called LIMT (left) and the up-regulated lncRNA called LOC388796 (right). RNA abundance was determined using microarrays (red) and real-time qPCR (blue) and presented as fold-change relative to time zero. Beta-2-microglobulin was used for normalization.</text>

      <text>(B) Shown are Kaplan-Meier plots of overall survival and relapse-free survival for the EGF-regulated lncRNA called LIMT. To obtain the data, we overlapped the list of EGF-regulated lncRNAs with the METABRIC clinical dataset (Illumina platform; left panel) and the KM-plotter dataset (Affymetrix platform; right panel). The red and blue lines of the left panel correspond to high and low expressors, respectively (each shows one third of the population; 1129 out of a total of 1,693 patients). The same applies to the right panel, except that the population was divided into two equal size groups (N=1,660 patients).</text>

      <text>(C) Coding potentials of clinically significant lncRNAs were calculated using CPAT, and they are individually presented along with the mean coding probabilities of control groups of protein coding RNAs and lncRNAs (in blue). Note that two variants of LINC00472 and LINC00652 are presented. (D) Evolutionary conservation of the primary nucleotide sequences of the clinically significant EGF-regulated lncRNAs was calculated using PhyloP across 100 vertebrates. Individual conservation scores are presented along with that of control groups of protein coding RNAs and non-coding RNAs (in blue).</text>

      <text>MCF10A cells were transfected with LIMT-specific siRNAs (or with control siRNA) and their migration (A, left panels) or invasion (B, left panels) were determined. Likewise, cells were stably transfected with plasmids encoding for shRNAs against LIMT (middle panels) or with plasmid encoding for either LIMT or eGFP (Control). Also shown is quantification of cell migration and invasion upon lncRNA knockdown and over-expression (OX). P-values of one-way ANOVA are presented. Each assay was repeated at least 3 times.</text>

      <text>(A) RFP-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells stably overexpressing LIMT or eGFP were injected into the tail vein of 5-week old female SCID mice (150,000 cells/mouse). Eighteen days after injection, lungs were excised and imaged. The number of metastatic nodules in each lung was quantified and presented in a dot plot. The horizontal lines represent median number of nodules per animal of each group. Each dot of the left panel represents one animal. The experiment was repeated twice (N = 18 and 14 for LIMT and eGFP overexpression, respectively). Shown are representative fluorescence images of lungs from the LIMT overexpression group and the control group. Scale bar, 0.5 cm. A two-way ANOVA was applied to evaluate differences between groups.</text>

      <text>(A) Schematic representation of the annotated RefSeq gene models of LIMT (NR_002809; chromosome 12q24.31) and the neighboring protein-coding genes (RHOF and SETD1B). Arrows denote direction of transcription (note that LIMT resides on the minus strand). Also shown is the distribution of evolutionary conservation along the sequence of LIMT across 100 vertebrate species. Note that the 5' region of LIMT is highly conserved (green rectangle). Promoter-associated histone methylation (H3K4Me3) and acetylation (H3K27Ac3) were obtained in MCF7 and MCF10A cells, respectively (see Methods). Acetylation signals were obtained for MCF10A cells stimulated with EGF for 20 minutes (green), or un-stimulated (black; overlaying histogram). Note that stimulation with EGF caused a decrease in acetylation at the promoter region (red rectangle).</text>

      <text>The expression of LIMT is shown relative to (A) PAM50 subtypes (N=381 patients), (B) tumor grade (N=309), (C) HER2 status (N=309) and (D) ER status (N=381 patients). Expression of individual lncRNAs was determined in tumors from breast cancer patients of the Oslo2 study using Agilent arrays. Molecular subtypes of the corresponding tumors were determined by using the PAM50 classifier. The Student's t-test was applied to evaluate differences in lncRNA expression between two groups. To evaluate differences in expression among three or more groups, we applied one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).</text>
